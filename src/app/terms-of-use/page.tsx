          <li>
            <strong>Paid services</strong>: The Service Provider offers both free and
            paid Services. Unless indicated otherwise, the Services are offered for
            free. However, certain transactions carried out via the Services may be
            subject to a fee (&quot;Protocol Fee&quot; and “Gas Fee”) in accordance
            with the Fee Schedule available on the Website.
          </li>

            of smart contracts that forward the transaction to the final destination.
            These smart contracts are deployed by Kindness.id. (ii) Gas Fee: This fee
            is for the Ethereum nodes to validate the transaction. It is not related

        <h3>7. Transactions</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Smart contracts/P2P assumption</strong>: The Service Provider
            provides a web3 service that enables automated membership management, and
            the use of the Services may result in certain transactions between users.
            The nature of such transactions is entirely P2P (peer-to-peer), and the
            Service Provider has no control whatsoever over the transmission,
            processing, and execution of such transactions. The Service Provider is
            not a financial institution, payments processor, crypto-asset service
            provider, creditor, wallet provider, exchange, or financial advisor. The
            Service Provider cannot make any representation or guarantee regarding
            any specific outcomes resulting from making digital assets available for
            minting or collecting, or engaging in any other transactions or
            activities via the Services.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Risk assumption</strong>: The transactions that can be carried
            out via the Services rely upon certain blockchain technology, including
            decentralized, distributed public ledger(s). By accessing or using the
            Services, you confirm that you are aware of the risks inherent in such
            technologies, such as the uncertainty of the regulatory regime governing
            blockchain technologies, digital assets, tokens and cryptocurrencies, the
            immutable nature of blockchain-based transactions, the novel and
            experimentative status of blockchain technology, and that the lack of use
            or public interest in the creation and development of distributed
            ecosystems could negatively impact the development of those ecosystems as
            well as the potential utility or value of such assets. You also confirm
            that you are aware that the price and liquidity of blockchain-based
            assets, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs), are extremely volatile and
            may be subject to fluctuations. Fluctuations in the price of other
            blockchain-based assets could materially and adversely affect digital
            assets. You also confirm that you are aware that the potential utility or
            value of such digital assets may go to zero, and that the Service
            Provider in no way or form guarantees the potential utility or value of
            such digital assets.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Platform only</strong>: You expressly acknowledge that the
            Service Provider provides a platform only, and it is not party to any
            smart contracts, arrangements or agreements. The Service Provider does
            not have custody or control over any digital assets issued on blockchain
            networks or protocols, including fungible and non-fungible digital assets
            (&quot;Tokens&quot;) you are interacting with, and we do not execute or
            effectuate issuances, purchases, transfers, or sales of Tokens. You are
            responsible for verifying the identity, legitimacy, and authenticity of
            Tokens that you purchase from third-party sellers using the Services and
            we make no claims, guarantees, or recommendations about the identity,
            legitimacy, functionality, or authenticity of users, Tokens (and any
            content associated with such Tokens) visible on the Service. It is your
            sole responsibility to verify all transaction details before initiating
            such transactions. You should always carefully check the relevant
            transaction details. The Service Provider is not responsible or liable
            for any losses you may incur due to incorrect transaction information.

            <strong>Expiration of Claims</strong>: Both parties agree that except for
            claims related to the indemnification obligations above, all claims
            arising under or related to this Agreement must be brought within one

          <li>
            <strong>Assignment</strong>: You may not assign or transfer this
            Agreement or any rights or obligations under this Agreement without the

            policies of an entity.

            rules of law. Any consumer complaints relating to this Agreement, or the
            Services may be communicated by the following means: (i) by sending a
            letter to the address of the Service Provider (6720 Szeged, Kelemen
            László utca 11.) or (ii) by sending an e-mail to
            <Anchor href="mailto:help@kindness.id" variant="highlighted">
              help@kindness.id
            </Anchor>
            . Any consumer complaint will be assessed and duly answered within 30
            days from the date when the complaint is received. If your complaint is
            rejected, then you may submit your complaint to the competent
            conciliation body at the place of your habitual or temporary residence.
            Prior to the proceeding of the conciliation body, you must attempt to
            solve the dispute with us directly. Should you decide to turn to a
            conciliation body other than the competent conciliation body, then – upon
            your request – that conciliation body will have competence to proceed. If
            you believe that your consumer rights have been violated, then you may
            also file a complaint with the competent consumer protection authority.
            The authority will decide whether to initiate proceedings upon the
            assessment of the complaint. The competence of the consumer protection
            authority depends on the place of your habitual residence. The list of
            authorities is available here. There is no code of practice available at
            the Service Provider as defined under the act on the prohibition of
            unfair commercial practices.
